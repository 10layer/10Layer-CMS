That means that you can publish to the web, Twitter, mobile, and other digital platforms from a single console, and still have the ability to customise a piece for each platform.</p>\n<p>\n	In addition, you can publish to different websites - perfect for an organisation that shares content between different publications.</p>\n<p>\n	Content can be &quot;forked&quot; or &quot;linked&quot; between platforms and publications. Forking means that a new atomic item is created. An edit on the forked item will not affect the original. Editing a linked item will affect both copies. This lets the editors choose whether they want to keep copy consistent across sites, or if they need to edit a piece for a different length or repackage it for a different audience.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Built for developers</strong></p>\n<p>\n	We&#39;ve made 10Layer highly extensible. We treat content in an object-orientated fashion, with a strong base object, and let you customise any content type you can imagine on top of it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n	This means that every publication can take advantage of its specific content mix, differentiating itself from other sites.</p>\n<p>\n	10Layer is open source, and built to be extended and played with. Each customers can customise it as little or as much as they like. We encourage feedback from our customers, and our development is extremely customer-driven, based on their needs.</p>\n<p>\n	<strong>Licence</strong></p>\n<p>\n	10Layer has a commercial, open source licence.
